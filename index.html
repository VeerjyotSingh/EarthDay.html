                While we need to reduce plastic use, managing huge amounts of plastic waste is also a 
                major issue. India generations approximately 5.6 million tons of plastic waste annually. 
                Much of this is not collected, managed, recycled or put to other use.

                <ol>

                <li>Religious leaders to have places of worship declared plastic-free zones</li>
                <li>Municipal corporations to have low-micron plastic bags banned</li>
                <li>Housing societies to educate them to segregate plastic waste</li>
                <li>Large shopping centers to request them to #SayNoToPlasticBags</li>
                <li>Visitors to not litter beaches, lands, rivers and mountains</li>

                Earth Day Network runs citizen-led initiatives to #EndPlasticPollution. 
                Working with multiple partners, we supported an All-India Plog Run across
                50 cities in India that had 2.8 million people participate. Major cleanups 
                have taken place on beaches in Maharashtra that include Mumbai's famous Juhu
                beach. Major hotel chains have come forward to support our campaign to 
                #RefuseTheStraw. Working with religious heads we have succeeded in getting
                major sites, visited by millions, declare themselves No Plastic Zones. Other 
                particular focus areas for #EndPlasticPollution campaigns are the entire 
                length of the River Ganges, all coastal regions, mountainous area and 2nd 
                Tier cities.

            <h2>#Trees4Earth</h2>
            <p>
                #Trees4Earth aims to inspire citizens of the Earth to plant trees to fight 
                climate change and restore habitats. Over 900 million trees have already been 
                planted in India since 2016, many through the efforts of governments, NGOs, 
                corporates, academic institutions, religious groups and individuals. Earth Day
                Network visits rural regions to help people understand that the fruit trees they 
                plant will shortly bear fruit to nourish their families and also generate income.
                In Lalitpur alone, one of India's most drough-prone areas, Earth Day Network
                distributed over 100,000 fruit saplings.

                Protecting Endangered Species from Extinction
            </h2>
            <p>
                India is home to over 91,000 species of animals and 45,000 species of plants that
                 flourish in the country's mountains, forests, seas, rivers, other water-bodies as 
                 well as in its deserts. There is a threat to their existence and urgent steps are 
                 essential to provide them protection. Primates, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians,
                  fish, spiders, coral, trees and plants make up close to 1,000 species from India 
                  that are placed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red 
                  List. Many of these are endemic to the land, and if not protected, will vanish 
                  forever from the face of the earth. Earth Day Network helps build awareness about 
                  the need to conserve the country's species and supports efforts on the ground. Our 
                  eBook on the subject documents many of these efforts.
